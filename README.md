This project analyzes the purchasing behavior of individuals in relation to bikes, with various demographic, economic, and geographical factors influencing their decision. The dataset includes the following columns:

ID: A unique identifier for each individual.
Marital Status: The marital status of the individual (e.g., married or single).
Gender: The gender of the individual.
Income: The income level of the individual, which could impact their ability to afford a bike.
Children: The number of children the individual has, which may correlate with transportation needs.
Education: The highest level of education attained by the individual.
Occupation: The individual's job role, which could influence their lifestyle and purchasing decisions.
Home Owner: Whether the individual owns a home, potentially indicating financial stability.
Cars: The number of cars owned by the individual, which may be related to their transportation choices.
Commute Distance: The distance the individual typically commutes, a key factor in determining bike utility.
Region: The geographic region where the individual resides.
Age: The age of the individual, which may influence their preferences and purchasing decisions.
Purchased Bike: The target variable indicating whether or not the individual purchased a bike (Yes/No).
Purpose and Objective:
The objective of the project is to identify key factors that influence bike purchases among different demographic groups. By analyzing patterns and correlations between the features, this project aims to provide insights that could help in targeted marketing and sales strategies for bike manufacturers and retailers.

Possible Use Cases:
Market Segmentation: Identifying different customer segments based on marital status, income, and region.
Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning models to predict whether a customer will purchase a bike based on their demographic and behavioral data.
Sales Strategy Optimization: Providing recommendations on where to focus sales efforts, considering factors like commute distance, car ownership, and region.
